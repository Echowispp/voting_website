# voting_website

This is a website you can vote on for what proect I'll do on #siege next week.

I'm aware that the themes are going to make it pretty hard, I'll work around that.

Also, turns out it's really fast to make this kind of website, I spent a bunch of time trying to figure out the graph (if there isn't one on the website, you can check the code to find all kinds of graph stuff unless I deleted it. Doubt I will though)
