        Aerial platformer: <span class="cand1_value">0</span>; Generative
        climber:
        <span class="cand2_value">0</span>
      </p>
      <button class="voteButton cand1_add" type="button">
        Aerial-only platformer; the player must use walljumps, dashes and such
        to move around
      </button>
      <button class="voteButton cand2_add" type="button">
        Generative climber; procedurally generated parkour, a take on those
        kinds usually mobile games, maybe with the walls-only mechanic
      </button>

      <p>
        Narrative-focused game: <span class="cand3_value">0</span>; Rubik's cube
        sim:
        <span class="cand4_value">0</span>
      </p>
      <button class="voteButton cand3_add" type="button">
        Narrative-focused maybe graphic novella; probably multiple endings
      </button>
      <button class="voteButton cand4_add" type="button">
        Rubik's cube sim; might be too small of a project to really fill the
        10h, I'll see what to do if needed
      </button>

      <p>How this works:</p>
      <p>You can vote for projects you'd like to see me do in future weeks!</p>
      <p>I'll try to do the most voted project next week,</p>
      <p>
        but if I don't find a way to stretch it to fit the theme, I'll have to
        delay it
      </p>
      <p>For the theme, I hope that votes are close enough to a 'currency'</p>
